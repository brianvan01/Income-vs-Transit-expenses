# Income-vs-Transit-expenses
This is my mini project to compare how much I earned from my jobs from Aug 2021 to July 2022 with how much I spent for my public transit (buses and car share service). The car share service in Vancouver is called Evo which is sponsored by BCAA (British Columbia Automobile Association).
